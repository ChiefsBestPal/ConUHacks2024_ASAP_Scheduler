`python csv_parser.py` to visualize the 2-phase scheduling algorithm in action as a numpy matrix prints in the console in 10 service bays / threads / rows.
Vehicle types are enums with custom attributes and there are a lot of very useful parsing and formatting functions as well as carefully designed data structures.
